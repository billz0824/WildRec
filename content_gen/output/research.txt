## Detailed Overview of ECON 310-1: Microeconomics

ECON 310-1 at Northwestern University is an advanced microeconomics course designed for economics majors and minors. It builds upon foundational concepts covered in ECON 202 (Introduction to Microeconomics) and delves deeper into the behavior of consumers and producers in market economies, using mathematical models to analyze market structures such as competition, monopoly, and monopsony[1][2][3].

### Key Topics and Concepts Covered

- **Market Equilibrium:** The course focuses on using supply and demand curves to analyze equilibrium and the effects of government interventions in competitive markets[1][4].
- **Consumer Theory:** Students learn to derive demand curves and analyze consumer welfare changes due to price shifts[4].
- **Producer Theory:** Emphasis is placed on understanding production functions, cost curves, and supply curves to characterize firm behavior[4].
- **Market Structures:** Analysis of market outcomes in perfect competition, monopoly, and monopsony settings[3][4].
- **Comparative Statics and Equilibrium Analysis:** These tools are used to model and analyze economic problems[1][3].

### Learning Objectives

After completing this course, students will be able to:
1. **Analyze Market Equilibrium:** Use supply and demand curves to study equilibrium and government interventions[1][4].
2. **Characterize Consumer Behavior:** Derive demand curves and assess welfare changes due to price shifts[4].
3. **Describe Firm Behavior:** Analyze production functions, cost curves, and supply curves for firms[4].
4. **Compare Market Structures:** Understand market outcomes in different competitive environments[3][4].

Additional goals include developing numeracy, improving problem-solving skills, and applying economic theory to real-world issues[1][2].

### Typical Assignments or Projects

- **Weekly Problem Sets:** Due on Mondays, with the option to drop the two lowest scores[2][4].
- **Exams:** Four exams, including a cumulative final, that test theoretical application and understanding[2][4].
- No calculators are allowed on exams to emphasize basic arithmetic operations[1][4].

### Required Textbooks

The specific textbook is not mentioned in the available syllabi. However, it's common for such courses to use textbooks like "Microeconomics" by Gregory Mankiw or similar advanced microeconomics texts.

### Syllabus Information

- **Prerequisites:** ECON 201 (Introduction to Macroeconomics), ECON 202 (Introduction to Microeconomics), and MATH 220-1 (Differential Calculus)[1][2][3].
- **Meeting Time:** Typically meets Monday, Wednesday, Friday at 10:00 AM - 10:50 AM[3].
- **Evaluation:** Based on four exams and weekly problem sets. Exams account for 420 points, and problem sets account for 60 points[2][4].
