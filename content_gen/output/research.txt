Here is the most up-to-date information about Northwestern University's course "ECON 310: Microeconomics," specifically focusing on "ECON 310-1" and "ECON 310-2."

## Detailed Overview of the Course
The Northwestern University course "ECON 310-1: Microeconomics I" offers a rigorous treatment of core microeconomic concepts. It builds upon the foundational course "ECON 202" and delves into mathematical models for analyzing consumer and producer behavior in market economies. The course emphasizes equilibrium analysis and comparative statics in competitive and monopolistic markets[1][3].

"ECON 310-2: Microeconomics II" continues this sequence by exploring advanced microeconomic topics, including social wellbeing, social choice, risk and uncertainty, information asymmetries, game theory, market spillovers, and general equilibrium[3][5].

## Key Topics and Concepts Covered
- **ECON 310-1:**
  - Consumer behavior and the theory of demand
  - Costs of production and equilibrium in competitive and monopolistic markets[1][3].
- **ECON 310-2:**
  - Social wellbeing and social choice
  - Risk and uncertainty
  - Information asymmetries
  - Game theory
  - Market spillovers
  - General equilibrium[3][5].

## Learning Objectives
For **ECON 310-1**, objectives include:
1. Analyzing supply and demand curves for equilibrium and resource allocation.
2. Deriving demand curves from consumer choices and assessing welfare changes.
3. Characterizing firm technology using production functions and cost curves.
4. Comparing outcomes in competitive, monopoly, and monopsony markets[1].

For **ECON 310-2**, objectives typically involve applying microeconomic tools to analyze complex market interactions and decision-making under uncertainty.

## Typical Assignments or Projects
Typical assignments are likely to include:
- Mathematical problem sets applying calculus to microeconomic concepts.
- Analysis of case studies or data to illustrate market dynamics.
- Discussion sections focusing on applying theoretical models to real-world scenarios[1].
