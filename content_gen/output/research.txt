## Detailed Overview of Course Content

**Econ 310-1: Microeconomics** at Northwestern University is an intermediate course designed primarily for economics majors and minors. It builds upon the foundational concepts of microeconomics covered in ECON 202, using mathematical models to analyze the behavior of consumers and producers in market economies. The course covers key topics such as equilibrium analysis, constrained optimization, and comparative statics to understand markets under different conditions like competition, monopoly, and monopsony[1][2][3].

## Key Topics and Concepts

- **Equilibrium Analysis**: Understanding how supply and demand curves interact to determine market equilibria.
- **Constrained Optimization**: Analyzing consumer and producer choices under budget and resource constraints.
- **Comparative Statics**: Examining how changes in economic variables affect market outcomes.
- **Consumer Theory**: Deriving demand curves and analyzing consumer welfare.
- **Producer Theory**: Applying production functions and cost curves to analyze firm behavior.
- **Market Structures**: Analyzing perfect competition, monopoly, and monopsony[1][2][4].

## Learning Objectives

After completing this course, students are expected to:
1. Use supply and demand curves to analyze equilibrium and efficient resource allocation.
2. Derive a consumer's demand curve and assess changes in consumer welfare.
3. Characterize a firm's production technology using cost and supply curves.
4. Compare market outcomes across different market structures[1][2][3].

## Typical Assignments or Projects

- **Weekly Problem Sets**: These are crucial for practicing problem-solving skills and are graded, contributing to a significant portion of the course grade[1][2].
- **Exams**: The course includes four exams (three in-class and one cumulative final), which test students' ability to apply microeconomic theory[1][2].

## Required Textbooks

While there isn't a single required textbook specified in all versions of the syllabus, **"Microeconomics" by Besanko and Braeutigam (6th edition)** is recommended as a reference for some sections of the course[4].
