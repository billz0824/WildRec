## Detailed Overview of the Course Content
ECON 310-1 is a course tailored primarily for economics majors and minors, focusing on the development and application of economic theory using mathematical models. It builds on concepts introduced in ECON 202, delving deeper into the behavior of optimizing consumers and producers in market economies. The course covers the fundamental workings of markets, including equilibrium analysis and comparative statics to understand competitive, monopolistic, and monopsonistic markets[1][2].

## Key Topics and Concepts Covered
Key topics include:
- **Consumer Behavior**: Analyzing satisfaction-maximizing choices under budget constraints and deriving demand curves[1][2].
- **Production and Cost Analysis**: Examining a firm's technology using production functions, cost curves, and supply curves[1][2].
- **Market Structures**: Understanding equilibrium in perfectly competitive, monopoly, and possibly monopsony markets[1][2].

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
1. Use supply and demand curves to analyze equilibrium and government interventions in competitive markets.
2. Model consumer demand and assess welfare changes due to price shifts.
3. Characterize firms' technologies and production decisions.
4. Compare market outcomes across different market structures[1][2].

## Typical Assignments or Projects
Assignments include **weekly problem sets** and **four exams**, with no calculators allowed during exams to emphasize problem-solving without technology[2]. Students are encouraged to practice with old exams and end-of-chapter exercises for reinforcement[2].

## Required Textbooks
The specific required textbooks are not explicitly mentioned in the available search results.
