## Course Overview
ECON 310-1 is an intermediate microeconomics course designed for economics majors and minors. It builds upon the foundational material covered in ECON 202, focusing on the development and application of economic theory using mathematical models. The course analyzes the behavior of optimizing consumers and producers in market economies, covering topics such as equilibrium analysis and comparative statics[1][2][3].

## Key Topics and Concepts
- **Supply and Demand Curves**: Analyzing equilibrium and resource allocation, along with the effects of government intervention[1][2].
- **Consumer Theory**: Deriving demand curves and evaluating consumer welfare changes due to price shifts[2][3].
- **Producer Theory**: Analyzing production functions, cost curves, and supply curves[1][3].
- **Market Structures**: Understanding competitive, monopoly, and monopsony markets[1][2].

## Learning Objectives
By completing this course, students will be able to:
1. **Analyze Equilibrium and Resource Allocation**: Use supply and demand curves to understand markets and government intervention[1][2].
2. **Apply Consumer Theory**: Derive demand curves and assess consumer welfare changes[2][3].
3. **Understand Producer Behavior**: Analyze production functions and cost curves for firms[1][3].
4. **Compare Market Structures**: Evaluate market outcomes in different structures[3].

## Typical Assignments or Projects
The course includes:
- **Weekly Problem Sets**: Due each Monday[1][2].
- **Exams**: There are four exams; the final is cumulative[1][2].

## Required Textbook
For one version of the course, the recommended textbook is "Microeconomics" by Besanko and Braeutigam (6th edition), though other intermediate micro textbooks can be used for reference[4].

## Syllabus Information
**Prerequisites**: Completion of ECON 201, ECON 202, and MATH 220-1 (or equivalents)[1][2][3].
**Assessment**: Course grade based on problem sets (60 points) and four exams, with the best three exams counted towards the final grade[1][2]. 
**Course Duration and Schedule**: Typically involves three lectures and a discussion section per week[3].
