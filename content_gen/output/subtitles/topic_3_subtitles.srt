Alright folks, here’s a brain tickler
for you: Why did the economist break
up with the production function? Because
it just wasn’t producing enough curve
appeal! Welcome to today’s university
comedy crash course where we’re talking
about the oh-so-sexy world of production
functions and firm behavior. You thought
economics wasn’t funny? Well, just wait
until you hear about cost curves! Buckle
up—and let's unravel why understanding
how a firm behaves is more complicated
than my family at Thanksgiving dinner.

00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,159
Great to be here! So, let's get into
it. Production functions describe the
relationship between the inputs a firm
uses—like labor and capital—and the maximum
output it can produce. It’s like baking:
more ingredients, more cake... up to
a point. As you add more inputs, the
additional output may start to decline.
Cost curves, on the other hand, help
firms decide at what point the cost of
producing one more unit is too high to
continue profitably. Together, with supply
curves, we can get a full picture of
a firm's behavior and decision-making
processes in various market settings.

00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:11,079
So, if a firm is a pizza place, are cost
curves the ones telling them to stop
adding so much pineapple?

4
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:16,479
Exactly, and even more so, they help
decide if pineapple should be on the
menu at all! Firms use these models to
make decisions like how much to produce
and at what price point to sell, which
is crucial whether they're in a competitive
market or a monopoly. Ultimately, this
analysis helps firms maximize profit
by identifying the most efficient level
of production. So in essence, those charts
and graphs? They’re basically the Google
Maps of economics!

 You thought economics wasn't funny?

00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,079
 Well, just wait until you hear about cost curves.

00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:31,879
 Buckle up, and let's unravel why understanding how a firm behaves is more complicated than

00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:34,240
 my family at Thanksgiving dinner.

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,200
 Great to be here, so let's get into it.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,319
 Production functions describe the relationship between the inputs a firm uses, like labor

12
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:45,639
 and capital, and the maximum output it can produce.

13
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:50,639
 It's like baking, more ingredients, more cake, up to a point.

14
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:55,360
 As you add more inputs, the additional output may start to decline.

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,119
 Cost curves, on the other hand, help firms decide at what point the cost of producing

16
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,520
 one more unit is too high to continue profitably.

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,940
 Together with supply curves, we can get a full picture of a firm's behavior and decision-making

18
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,720
 processes in various market settings.

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,839
 So if a firm is a pizza place, are cost curves the ones telling them to stop adding so much

20
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:17,839
 pineapple?

21
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:24,099
 Exactly, and even more so, they help decide if pineapple should be on the menu at all.

22
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:27,580
 Analysts use these models to make decisions like how much to produce and at what price

23
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:33,139
 point to sell, which is crucial whether they're in a competitive market or a monopoly.

24
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:38,480
 Ultimately, this analysis helps firms maximize profit by identifying the most efficient level

25
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,300
 of production.

26
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:45,220
 So in essence, those charts and graphs, they're basically the Google Maps of economics.
