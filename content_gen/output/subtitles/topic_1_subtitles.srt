00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Ever wonder why your favorite cup of
coffee keeps getting pricier, yet the
barista's smile

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:13,199
stays the same? That's economics,
folks. Welcome to Econ 310. I'm your
host, ready to tickle your

3
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:20,079
funny bone while we navigate through
equilibrium analysis and constrained
optimization, which,

4
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:25,840
let's be honest, sounds like you trying
to balance your love for avocado toast
on a budget.

5
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:32,319
Here's our expert, Dr. Smith, to
explain how microeconomic models help
us make sense of

6
00:00:32,319 --> 00:00:38,400
these mysteries. Thanks for having me.
In Econ 310, we look at how individuals
and

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:45,119
firms make decisions with limited
resources. Think of markets as a big
dinner party. Equilibrium is

8
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,159
when everyone has just enough of
everything without any leftovers,
balancing supply and demand.

9
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,639
Constrained optimization, that's
choosing the best Netflix series under
your time constraints,

10
00:00:56,639 --> 00:01:01,520
and we analyze different market
structures. Imagine a world where your
favorite cereal

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,919
brand has no competition versus tons of
options. These concepts help us
understand and predict

12
00:01:07,919 --> 00:01:13,519
market behaviors under various
conditions. So if understanding these
concepts is like a

13
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:19,519
dinner party, are exams more of a food
fight? Well, exams test your ability to
apply these

14
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:25,440
theories, kind of like prepping a meal
without burning it. Weekly problem sets
are like taste

15
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,639
tests. Practice making perfect dishes,
or in this case, perfect market
analyses.

16
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,919
By the end of the course, you'll master
using supply and demand curves and
differentiate

17
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:42,160
between competition, monopoly, or
monopsony markets. A little less food
fight, more like

18
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,680
 a gourmet meal challenge.
