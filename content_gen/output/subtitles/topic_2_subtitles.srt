Alright, folks, ever wonder why your
favorite cereal costs more than your
monthly streaming service subscription?
Welcome to the wonderful world of demand
curves, where mysterious forces of economics
determine if you can actually afford
to eat breakfast. I'm your comedic guide
through this economic jungle. Let's dive
into how we derive these mystical curves
and what happens when prices play hopscotch.

00:00:05,119 --> 00:00:11,199
Thanks for having me. In microeconomics,
a demand curve is essentially a graph
that depicts how much of a product consumers
are willing to buy at different price
levels. To derive them, we use consumer
theory, which involves analyzing preferences
and constraints. When prices change,
we assess consumer welfare by determining
how these changes affect their utility.
It's a balancing act of what consumers
want versus what they're willing to pay.

00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:16,879
So, if prices are doing the cha-cha,
does that mean consumer happiness is
dancing too?

4
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:22,719
In a way, yes! When prices drop, typically,
consumer welfare or happiness increases
because they can buy more with the same
budgetâ€”think more Netflix, less chill
on spending. Conversely, when prices
rise, consumers may sacrifice other purchases
to maintain their usual consumption level.
Understanding these dynamics is crucial
in microeconomics for evaluating market
efficiency and consumer satisfaction.
