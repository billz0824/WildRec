          "text": "That's a great question! Consumers face budget constraints, meaning they have limited resources to spend on goods and services. To maximize their satisfaction, they make choices that provide the greatest benefit for their money. Economists use utility functions to model this behavior, helping us understand the trade-offs that consumers face. By analyzing these choices, we can derive demand curves, which represent the relationship between price and quantity demanded. Various factors, such as income and preferences, influence consumer decisions and the shape of these curves.",

By modeling demand, economists can assess how changes in price impact consumer welfare. This analysis helps policymakers predict the effects of taxes, subsidies, and other interventions on market outcomes and consumer well-being. Ultimately, it's about understanding how shifts in price can lead to changes in consumer choices and overall satisfaction.",

By analyzing these functions, firms can determine the most efficient combination of inputs to maximize output while minimizing costs.
